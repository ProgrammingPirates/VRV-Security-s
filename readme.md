# **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) System**

## **Project Overview**

This project demonstrates the implementation of an **Authentication**, **Authorization**, and **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** system. It ensures secure user authentication, role assignment, and access control to resources based on roles and permissions. The system is built with a focus on security best practices and modular design.

---

## **Features**

### **Authentication**
- User registration with secure password hashing.
- User login with secure session management (JWT/OAuth).
- Logout functionality to revoke access tokens or sessions.

### **Authorization**
- Role-based authorization (e.g., Admin, User, Moderator).
- Access control to specific resources or endpoints based on roles and permissions.

### **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
- Dynamic role assignment to users.
- Permission-based access control tied to roles.
- Middleware to enforce access restrictions based on user roles.

### **Additional Features**
- Password reset functionality.
- Activity logging for user actions.
- Secure API endpoints protected with JWT/OAuth.
- Scalable and modular codebase.

---

## **Technologies Used**

- **Backend Framework**: Laravel / Express.js / php
- **Database**: MySQL / PostgreSQL 
- **Authentication**: JSON Web Tokens (JWT) / OAuth
- **Frontend Framework**: React.js / Vue.js / Angular
- **Other Tools**: Middleware for request validation, bcrypt for password hashing, role and permission middleware.

---

## **System Architecture**

The system is designed with a modular and scalable architecture:
1. **Authentication Module**:
   - Handles user registration, login, and logout.
   - Uses hashed passwords and secure token-based session management.

2. **Authorization Module**:
   - Ensures users can only access resources based on assigned roles.
   - Middleware enforces access restrictions dynamically.

3. **RBAC Module**:
   - Role and permission management system.
   - Easily configurable for new roles and permissions.

## **How to Use**

### **1. Registration and Login**
- Register as a new user at `/register`.
- Login with your credentials at `/login` to receive an access token.

### **2. Role Management**
- Assign roles (Admin, User, Moderator) through the admin panel or API endpoints.

### **3. Access Restricted Endpoints**
- Access resources based on roles and permissions. Unauthorized users will receive a `403 Forbidden` response.

---

## **API Endpoints**

### **Authentication**
- `POST /api/register` - Register a new user.
- `POST /api/login` - Login and get an access token.
- `POST /api/logout` - Logout and revoke the token.

### **Role Management**
- `POST /api/roles` - Create a new role.
- `GET /api/roles` - View all roles.

### **Access Control**
- Protected routes based on user roles (e.g., `/admin`, `/moderator`, `/user`).


## **Installation**

### **Prerequisites**
- **PHP** (v8.2 or later recommended)
- **Composer** (for managing PHP dependencies)
- **MySQL or any SQL Database**
- **Laravel Framework**

### **Steps to Install**

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd vrv
   ```

2. **Install PHP dependencies using Composer**:
   ```bash
   composer install
   ```

3. **Configure Environment Variables**:
   Copy the example `.env` file to create a new `.env` file:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   Open the `.env` file and configure the following:
   ```env
   DB_CONNECTION=mysql
   DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
   DB_PORT=3306
   DB_DATABASE=your_database_name
   DB_USERNAME=your_database_username
   DB_PASSWORD=your_database_password

   JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key
   ```

4. **Generate Laravel application key**:
   ```bash
   php artisan key:generate
   ```

5. **Run migrations** to create necessary database tables:
   ```bash
   php artisan migrate
   ```

6. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   php artisan serve
   ```

   This will start the server on `http://localhost:8000`.
